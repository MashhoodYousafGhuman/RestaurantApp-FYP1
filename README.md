The project Restaurant Managment System was first the project without any database or server, but now it has been transformed with firebase/firestore to manage data and cloudinary to manage files.

<!-- Admin -->
It includes an admin route to perfrom CRUD on menus but can only be accessible with admin credentials like admin email and password.
admin email is schoolold454

<!-- Blank or Redundant files -->
Some files maybe blank or unused due to the transformation of code from local to firebase 

<!-- Why keeping unused files? -->
Just for the memeory call because it also contains some helpful logic for further projects.

<!-- Bucket in top right corner -->
You can see your total bill by clicking on bucket icon

Note: Admin Route is only accessible in Laptop devices!
